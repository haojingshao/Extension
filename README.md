# Extension
NA12878Termini.fa contains 7 chromosome termini(3q, 6p, 9q, 15q, 4q, 20p and 20q) in NA12878. These termini were longer than the sequences in GRCh37.  They were predicted by BioNano or nanopore reads.

If you use this data in your study, please cite my thesis: "Investigation of repetitive sequence in the human genome" or "Ongoing human chromosome end extension 1 revealed by analysis of BioNano and nanopore data".
